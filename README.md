## DISCLAIMER - READ FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING ANYTHING

- **TAKE OUT THE SD CARD BEFORE OPENING THE STEAM DECK OR IT WILL BREAK!!!**
- **VALVE ALSO RECOMMENDS PUTTING THE DEVICE INTO BATTERY STORAGE MODE FOR REPAIRS!!!**
    - [How to turn on battery storage mode](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Enable+Steam+Deck+Battery+Storage+Mode/149962)
        - **MAKE SURE THE BATTERY IS BELOW 80% BEFORE PUTTING IT INTO BATTERY STORAGE MODE, THE LOWER THE BETTER** (though full discharge isn't recommended)
- **DISCONNECT THE BATTERY AFTER TAKING OFF THE SHIELDING!!!**
